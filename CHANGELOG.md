## 4chan XT changelog

4chan XT uses a different user script namespace than 4chan X, so to migrate you need to export settings from 4chan X,
and import them in XT.

### 2.24.2 (2025-12-23 🎅🏻)

I'm officially stopping XT since I don't use 4chan anymore. This update removes the update URL, and merges the last two
bug fix pull requests that were open.

- Fix file redirect for palanq.win [#205](https://github.com/TuxedoTako/4chan-xt/pull/205)

  like StyleChan.

- Convert various Unicode characters to SVG icons. [#141](https://github.com/TuxedoTako/4chan-xt/pull/141)
  by [@saxamaphone69](https://github.com/saxamaphone69)

  [#133](https://github.com/TuxedoTako/4chan-xt/issues/133)
- Changed the init script to allow for a reflow between the loading of the custom style among others, and parsing the
  thread. This should lessen the flash on page load.
- Added a new option in the date format for a month number without zero padding: `%n`.

### 2.19.0 (2024-12-22)

- Removed the css for the header for widths above 1300px, because it was preventing long custom navigation lists from
  wrapping. [#120](https://github.com/TuxedoTako/4chan-xt/issues/120) I don't know what the purpose was of the different
  style, the commit where that was added isn't really descriptive: c396db49b9d8fe1becad2fd9c8b29e88ead7b587? So let me
  know if I broke something.

- The quick reply now supports mp4. [#124](https://github.com/TuxedoTako/4chan-xt/pull/124)

  - This version only works on chromium.

- Fixed quoted OPs not showing reply and image count. [#71](https://github.com/TuxedoTako/4chan-xt/issues/71) Might be a
  new feature, since it seems it was never supported, but I'm counting it as a bug fix because native 4chan has it.

- Address wobbly spin animation. [#65](https://github.com/TuxedoTako/4chan-xt/pull/65)

  This should only be important if you use custom css to style it.

- PostHiding now waits for the board config, so the option to hide by poster ID should always appear on boards with
  those. [#41 (comment)](https://github.com/TuxedoTako/4chan-xt/issues/41#issuecomment-2087805190)
- Restoring deleted posts from archives when reply threading is active no longer recalculates the threads. Turning reply
  threading off and on again still works. [#55](https://github.com/TuxedoTako/4chan-xt/issues/55)

### 2.8.1 (2024-04-23)

- Fixed quick reply modal putting icon buttons in the wrong place in the catalog.
  [#54](https://github.com/TuxedoTako/4chan-xt/issues/54)
- Removed 'Work around CORB Bug', which was fixed in chrome 85, while this script is 90 and up.
  - Because this meant a file had a dependency less, which in combination with the circular dependencies, caused some
    files to be in a different order in the output, and caused some common variables to not have `$1` appended. So sorry
    for the giant diff.
- Code specific for the userscript isn't in the chrome extension anymore and vice versa.

  failing silently. [#53](https://github.com/TuxedoTako/4chan-xt/issues/53)

- Right-align shortcut icons in header when header links are centered.
  [#45](https://github.com/TuxedoTako/4chan-xt/pull/45)

    [#44](https://github.com/TuxedoTako/4chan-xt/issues/44)

- Fixed poster IDs not appearing on new posts. [#20](https://github.com/TuxedoTako/4chan-xt/issues/20)

### v2.3.4 (2023-12-31)

- Fixed previewing posts from external archives inserting posts from other threads into the current thread.
  [#18](https://github.com/TuxedoTako/4chan-xt/issues/18)

### v2.3.3 (2023-12-30)

- Improved interaction between restoring from the archive and reply threading.
  - Known issue: parents from threads get put at the end instead of the correct place when reply threading is on.
- Previewing a deleted post from an external archive by hovering over a link no longer excludes it when restoring the
  thread from the archive. It now gets added direly when you do that.
  - Known issue: when reply threading is on, this moves the reply to the restored post, but doesn't scroll to it.
- Added a "Link Title in the catalog" setting for embeds as a workaround for
  [ccd0/4chan-x#3427](https://github.com/ccd0/4chan-x/issues/3427). Fetching titles in the catalog is off by default.
- Restored span around ➕︎ and ➖︎ icons in the index for user styles. [#17](https://github.com/TuxedoTako/4chan-xt/issues/17).

### v2.3.2 (2023-12-27)

- Fixed the settings import mistaking a 4chan XT config for a [loadletter/4chan-x](https://github.com/loadletter/4chan-x)
  one and failing. [#16](https://github.com/TuxedoTako/4chan-xt/issues/16)

### v2.3.1 (2023-12-26)

- Fixed classes on capcode. [#14](https://github.com/TuxedoTako/4chan-xt/issues/14)

### v2.3.0 (2023-12-25) (Merry Christmas)

- Added `.fourchan-xt` class. [#11](https://github.com/TuxedoTako/4chan-xt/issues/11)
- Added `window.fourchanXT` with the version number in `version` and a `buildDate` `Date` object.
- Version number is no longer prefixed with "XT ", and will now follow major.minor.bugfix.
- Fixed "Expand All Images" shortcut in the header. [#13](https://github.com/TuxedoTako/4chan-xt/issues/13)
- Ran the chrome extension version, and fixed a problem with the ajax function. How long has that been down? I use the
  user script version myself.

### XT v2.2.6 (2023-12-22)

- Fixed header shortcuts with text instead of icons. [#12](https://github.com/TuxedoTako/4chan-xt/issues/12)

### XT v2.2.5 (2023-12-21)

- Fixed posts scrolling under the header when navigated to by the id.
  [#10](https://github.com/TuxedoTako/4chan-xt/issues/10)
  - Now `scroll-margin-top` is used, which needed `overflow: clip;` instead of `:hidden`, which is why the minimum
    chrome version is bumped to 90.
- Disabled automatic retry when captcha failed. [ccd0/4chan-x\#3134](https://github.com/ccd0/4chan-x/issues/3134),
  [ccd0/4chan-x\#3424](https://github.com/ccd0/4chan-x/issues/3157).
  - I think. I honestly had trouble reproducing this issue.

- Fixed Index, Archive and Catalog navbar links no longer bold on blue boards:
  [ccd0/4chan-x\#3424](https://github.com/ccd0/4chan-x/issues/3424).

### XT v2.2.3 (2023-11-08)

- Fixed error when "Force Noscript Captcha" is enabled.

### XT v2.2.2 (2023-10-29)

- Fixed trying to get thread JSON from unsupported archives.

### XT v2.2.1 (2023-10-28)

- Fixed thread not scrolling to last read post.
- Set default 'Exempt Archives from Encryption' to false. This setting will _not_ change automatically when updating.
- Enabled automatic updates. If you don't want updates, turn them off in your user script manager.

### XT v2.2.0 (2023-10-27)

- Added ability to restore deleted posts from an external archive. This can be found in the drop down menu at the top

### XT v2.1.2 (2023-07-22)

- Fix inlining/previewing of archive links like quote links. [#5](https://github.com/TuxedoTako/4chan-xt/issues/5)

### XT v2.1.1 (2023-07-16)

- Time formatting now falls back to browser locale instead of giving an error when the locale is not set.
- Update notification link now links to the changelog on the right branch on github.

### XT v2.1.0 (2023-06-24)

- Limited support for audio posts: they work in threads but not yet in the gallery. Might add if there's demand.
  - Can be disabled in the settings
- Small performance improvements
  - Removed unnecessary `Array.from`s from coffeescript to js migration
  - Time module: cache Intl.DateTimeFormat objects
  - callbackNodesDB: increase nr of callbacks because the setTimeout triggers a reflow, which in some of my tests took
    as long as the actual chunk of callbacks

### XT v2.0.0 (2023-04-30)

This is the first XT release, which means this is after the migration from coffeescript to typescript, but there are
some other changes as well. These changes aren't in the upstream PR.

- Optimized image filters: filters are in a Map with the hash as key, instead of iterating over all image filters
- I removed font awesome to make the script smaller, and used unicode icons instead. This might break some user scripts
  build in 4chan X that rely on them, and I only tested on windows.
- For even smaller user script size, there is a minified version available
- https://github.com/ccd0/4chan-x/pull/3352, fix for https://github.com/ccd0/4chan-x/issues/3349 was ported
